Some datasets may be found in the datsets folder of the Google Drive folder for this course. Links to other possibilities are below. If you find other good resources, please consider adding them to this list. You can choose any dataset you find for your group project, although your final choice must be approved by the instructor. 


* Other datasets are available from [the Vanderbilt data website](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).
* The [Add Health website](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/data/publicdata/public-use-dataset-descriptions) has some public use datasets from the National Longitudinal study of Adolescent to Adult Health. 
* Public CDC data on influenza via the [FluView site](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html) or (more usefully in my experience) the [cdcfluview R package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/cdcfluview).
