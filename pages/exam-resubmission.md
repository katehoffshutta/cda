#### Midterm Exam

If you wish, you may resubmit the midterm exam to receive an "earned curve" your original exam grade. I will regrade the exam upon resubmission and average the two grades together to calculate the exam grade that will go in the grade book.

Here are the guidelines:

 - Once the exam is handed back, you may not consult with any human about the exam.
 - You may, however, use books and existing resources on the internet to help you approach solutions. Posting exam questions on internet forums with a request for assistance is not permitted.
 - The resubmission should be typed up, as other lab assignments have been, and both the source file and PDF should be submitted via Google Drive by 5pm on Tuesday, November 20. Please include, at the beginning of each part of each question, your original score on that part of the question.
